Several strategies for reducing the computation burden of {PCA} are explored, including both spatial and spectral subsampling in the covariance calculation as well as an iterative algorithm that circumvents determination of the covariance matrix entirely.

	abstract = {Hyperspectral ({HS}) images are characterized by approximately contiguous spectral information, enabling the fine identification of materials by capturing subtle spectral discrepancies. Owing to their excellent locally contextual modeling ability, convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) have been proven to be a powerful feature extractor in {HS} image classification. However, {CNNs} fail to mine and represent the sequence attributes of spectral signatures well due to the limitations of their inherent network backbone. To solve this issue, we rethink {HS} image classification from a sequential perspective with transformers, and propose a novel backbone network called {\textbackslash}ul\{{SpectralFormer}\}. Beyond band-wise representations in classic transformers, {SpectralFormer} is capable of learning spectrally local sequence information from neighboring bands of {HS} images, yielding group-wise spectral embeddings. More significantly, to reduce the possibility of losing valuable information in the layer-wise propagation process, we devise a cross-layer skip connection to convey memory-like components from shallow to deep layers by adaptively learning to fuse "soft" residuals across layers. It is worth noting that the proposed {SpectralFormer} is a highly flexible backbone network, which can be applicable to both pixel- and patch-wise inputs. We evaluate the classification performance of the proposed {SpectralFormer} on three {HS} datasets by conducting extensive experiments, showing the superiority over classic transformers and achieving a significant improvement in comparison with state-of-the-art backbone networks. The codes of this work will be available at https://github.com/danfenghong/{IEEE}\_TGRS\_SpectralFormer for the sake of reproducibility.},

	abstract = {Recently, a great many deep convolutional neural network ({CNN})-based methods have been proposed for hyperspectral image ({HSI}) classification. Although the proposed {CNN}-based methods have the advantages of spatial feature extraction, they are difficult to handle the sequential data with and {CNNs} are not good at modeling the long-range dependencies. However, the spectra of {HSI} are a kind of sequential data, and {HSI} usually contains hundreds of bands. Therefore, it is difficult for {CNNs} to handle {HSI} processing well. On the other hand, the Transformer model, which is based on an attention mechanism, has proved its advantages in processing sequential data. To address the issue of capturing relationships of sequential spectra in {HSI} in a long distance, in this study, Transformer is investigated for {HSI} classification. Specifically, in this study, a new classification framework titled spatial-spectral Transformer ({SST}) is proposed for {HSI} classification. In the proposed {SST}, a well-designed {CNN} is used to extract the spatial features, and a modified Transformer (a Transformer with dense connection, i.e., {DenseTransformer}) is proposed to capture sequential spectra relationships, and multilayer perceptron is used to finish the final classification task. Furthermore, dynamic feature augmentation, which aims to alleviate the overfitting problem and therefore generalize the model well, is proposed and added to the {SST} ({SST}-{FA}). In addition, to address the issue of limited training samples in {HSI} classification, transfer learning is combined with {SST}, and another classification framework titled transferring-{SST} (T-{SST}) is proposed. At last, to mitigate the overfitting problem and improve the classification accuracy, label smoothing is introduced for the T-{SST}-based classification framework (T-{SST}-L). The proposed {SST}, {SST}-{FA}, T-{SST}, and T-{SST}-L are tested on three widely used hyperspectral datasets. The obtained results reveal that the proposed models provide competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art methods, which shows that the concept of Transformer opens a new window for {HSI} classification.},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral compression is one of the most common techniques in hyperspectral image processing. Most recent learned image compression methods have exhibited excellent rate-distortion performance for natural images, but they have not been fully explored for hyperspectral compression tasks. In this paper, we propose a trainable network architecture for hyperspectral compression tasks, which not only considers the anisotropic characteristic of hyperspectral images but also embeds an accurate entropy model using the non-Gaussian prior knowledge of hyperspectral images and nonlinear transform. Specifically, we first design a spatial-spectral block, involving a spatial net and a spectral net as the base components of the core autoencoder, which is more consistent with the anisotropic hyperspectral cubes than the existing compression methods based on deep learning. Then, we design a Student’s T hyperprior that merges the statistics of the latents and the side information concepts into a unified neural network to provide an accurate entropy model used for entropy coding. This not only remarkably enhances the flexibility of the entropy model by adjusting various values of the degree of freedom, but also leads to a superior rate-distortion performance. The results illustrate that the proposed compression scheme supersedes the Gaussian hyperprior universally for virtually all learned natural image codecs and the optimal linear transform coding methods for hyperspectral compression. Specifically, the proposed method provides a 1.51\% to 59.95\% average increase in peak signal-to-noise ratio, a 0.17\% to 18.17\% average increase in the structural similarity index metric and a 6.15\% to 64.60\% average reduction in spectral angle mapping over three public hyperspectral datasets compared to the Gaussian hyperprior and the optimal linear transform coding methods.},

	abstract = {Recent models for learned image compression are based on autoencoders that learn approximately invertible mappings from pixels to a quantized latent representation. The transforms are combined with an entropy model, which is a prior on the latent representation that can be used with standard arithmetic coding algorithms to generate a compressed bitstream. Recently, hierarchical entropy models were introduced as a way to exploit more structure in the latents than previous fully factorized priors, improving compression performance while maintaining end-to-end optimization. Inspired by the success of autoregressive priors in probabilistic generative models, we examine autoregressive, hierarchical, and combined priors as alternatives, weighing their costs and benefits in the context of image compression. While it is well known that autoregressive models can incur a significant computational penalty, we find that in terms of compression performance, autoregressive and hierarchical priors are complementary and can be combined to exploit the probabilistic structure in the latents better than all previous learned models. The combined model yields state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and generates smaller files than existing methods: 15.8\% rate reductions over the baseline hierarchical model and 59.8\%, 35\%, and 8.4\% savings over {JPEG}, {JPEG}2000, and {BPG}, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first learning-based method to outperform the top standard image codec ({BPG}) on both the {PSNR} and {MS}-{SSIM} distortion metrics.},

	abstract = {We describe an image compression method, consisting of a nonlinear analysis transformation, a uniform quantizer, and a nonlinear synthesis transformation. The transforms are constructed in three successive stages of convolutional linear filters and nonlinear activation functions. Unlike most convolutional neural networks, the joint nonlinearity is chosen to implement a form of local gain control, inspired by those used to model biological neurons. Using a variant of stochastic gradient descent, we jointly optimize the entire model for rate-distortion performance over a database of training images, introducing a continuous proxy for the discontinuous loss function arising from the quantizer. Under certain conditions, the relaxed loss function may be interpreted as the log likelihood of a generative model, as implemented by a variational autoencoder. Unlike these models, however, the compression model must operate at any given point along the rate-distortion curve, as specified by a trade-off parameter. Across an independent set of test images, we find that the optimized method generally exhibits better rate-distortion performance than the standard {JPEG} and {JPEG} 2000 compression methods. More importantly, we observe a dramatic improvement in visual quality for all images at all bit rates, which is supported by objective quality estimates using {MS}-{SSIM}.},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral sensor technology has been advancing in recent years and become more practical to tackle a variety of applications. The arising issues of data transmission and storage can be addressed with the help of compression. To minimize the loss of important information, high spectral correlation between adjacent bands is exploited. In this paper, we introduce an approach to compress hyperspectral data based on a 1D-Convolutional Autoencoder. Compression is achieved through reducing correlation by transforming the spectral signature into a low-dimensional space, while simultaneously preserving the significant features. The focus lies on compression of the spectral dimension. The spatial dimension is not used in the compression in order not to falsify correlation between the spectral dimension and accuracy of the reconstruction. The proposed 1D-Convolutional Autoencoder efficiently finds and extracts features relevant for compression. Additionally, it can be exploited as a feature extractor or for dimensionality reduction. The hyperspectral data sets Greding Village and Pavia University were used for the training and the evaluation process. The reconstruction accuracy is evaluated using the Signal to Noise Ratio and the Spectral Angle. Additionally, a land cover classification using a multi-class Support Vector Machine is used as a target application. The classification performance of the original and reconstructed data are compared. The reconstruction accuracy of the 1D-Convolutional Autoencoder outperforms the Deep Autoencoder and Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis for the used metrics and for both data sets using a fixed compression ratio.},

	abstract = {Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic metal that can accumulate in soils and negatively impact crop as well as human health. Amendments like biochar have potential to address these challenges by reducing Cd bioavailability in soil, though reliance on post-harvest wet chemical methods to quantify Cd uptake have slowed efforts to identify the most effective amendments. Hyperspectral imaging ({HSI}) is a novel technology that could overcome this limitation by quantifying symptoms of Cd stress while plants are still growing. The goals of this study were to: 1) determine whether {HSI} can detect Cd stress in two distinct leafy green crops, 2) quantify whether a locally sourced biochar derived from hardwoods can reduce Cd stress and uptake in these crops, and 3) identify vegetative indices ({VIs}) that best quantify changes in plant stress responses. Experiments were conducted in a tightly controlled automated phenotyping facility that allowed all environmental factors to be kept constant except Cd concentration (0, 5 10 and 15 mg kg−1). Symptoms of Cd stress were stronger in basil (Ocimum basilicum) than kale (Brassica oleracea), and were easier to detect using {HSI}. Several {VIs} detected Cd stress in basil, but only the anthocyanin reflectance index ({ARI}) detected all levels of Cd stress in both crop species. The biochar amendment did reduce Cd uptake, especially at low Cd concentrations in kale which took up more Cd than basil. Again, the {ARI} index was the most effective in quantifying changes in plant stress mediated by the biochar. These results indicate that the biochar evaluated in this study has potential to reduce Cd bioavailability in soil, and {HSI} could be further developed to identify rates that can best achieve this benefit. The technology also may be helping in elucidating mechanisms mediating how biochar can influence plant growth and stress responses.},

A potent approach is mechanical plastic sorting but sufficient analytical techniques are needed. This study applies unsupervised machine learning on short wave infrared hyperspectral data to build a model for classification of plastics. The model can successfully distinguish between twelve plastics ({PE}, {PP}, {PET}, {PS}, {PVC}, {PVDF}, {POM}, {PEEK}, {ABS}, {PMMA}, {PC}, and {PA}12) and the utility is further proven by recognizing three unknown samples ({PS}, {PMMA}, {PC}). The experimental setup is constructed similar to an in-line industrial setup, and the machine learning is optimized for minimal data processing. This ensures the industrial relevance and is a stepping-stone to solve the global plastic challenge.},

	abstract = {Imaging spectroscopy, also known as hyperspectral remote sensing, is based on the characterization of Earth surface materials and processes through spectrally-resolved measurements of the light interacting with matter. The potential of imaging spectroscopy for Earth remote sensing has been demonstrated since the 1980s. However, most of the developments and applications in imaging spectroscopy have largely relied on airborne spectrometers, as the amount and quality of space-based imaging spectroscopy data remain relatively low to date. The upcoming Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program ({EnMAP}) German imaging spectroscopy mission is intended to fill this gap. An overview of the main characteristics and current status of the mission is provided in this contribution. The core payload of {EnMAP} consists of a dual-spectrometer instrument measuring in the optical spectral range between 420 and 2450 nm with a spectral sampling distance varying between 5 and 12 nm and a reference signal-to-noise ratio of 400:1 in the visible and near-infrared and 180:1 in the shortwave-infrared parts of the spectrum. {EnMAP} images will cover a 30 km-wide area in the across-track direction with a ground sampling distance of 30 m. An across-track tilted observation capability will enable a target revisit time of up to four days at the Equator and better at high latitudes. {EnMAP} will contribute to the development and exploitation of spaceborne imaging spectroscopy applications by making high-quality data freely available to scientific users worldwide.},

	abstract = {In preparation for new-generation imaging spectrometer missions and the accompanying unprecedented inflow of hyperspectral data, optimized models are needed to generate vegetation traits routinely. Hybrid models, combining radiative transfer models with machine learning algorithms, are preferred, however, dealing with spectral collinearity imposes an additional challenge. In this study, we analyzed two spectral dimensionality reduction methods: principal component analysis ({PCA}) and band ranking ({BR}), embedded in a hybrid workflow for the retrieval of specific leaf area ({SLA}), leaf area index ({LAI}), canopy water content ({CWC}), canopy chlorophyll content ({CCC}), the fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation ({FAPAR}), and fractional vegetation cover ({FVC}). The {SCOPE} model was used to simulate training data sets, which were optimized with active learning. Gaussian process regression ({GPR}) algorithms were trained over the simulations to obtain trait-specific models. The inclusion of {PCA} and {BR} with 20 features led to the so-called {GPR}-20PCA and {GPR}-20BR models. The 20PCA models encompassed over 99.95\% cumulative variance of the full spectral data, while the {GPR}-20BR models were based on the 20 most sensitive bands. Validation against in situ data obtained moderate to optimal results with normalized root mean squared error ({NRMSE}) from 13.9\% ({CWC}) to 22.3\% ({CCC}) for {GPR}-20PCA models, and {NRMSE} from 19.6\% ({CWC}) to 29.1\% ({SLA}) for {GPR}-20BR models. Overall, the {GPR}-20PCA slightly outperformed the {GPR}-20BR models for all six variables. To demonstrate mapping capabilities, both models were tested on a {PRecursore} {IperSpettrale} della Missione Applicativa ({PRISMA}) scene, spectrally resampled to Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging Mission for the Environment ({CHIME}), over an agricultural test site (Jolanda di Savoia, Italy). The two strategies obtained plausible spatial patterns, and consistency between the two models was highest for {FVC} and {LAI} (R2=0.91, R2=0.86) and lowest for {SLA} mapping (R2=0.53). From these findings, we recommend implementing {GPR}-20PCA models as the most efficient strategy for the retrieval of multiple crop traits from hyperspectral data streams. Hence, this workflow will support and facilitate the preparations of traits retrieval models from the next-generation operational {CHIME}.},

	abstract = {The monitoring of soil moisture content ({SMC}) at very high spatial resolution ({\textless}10m) using unmanned aerial systems ({UAS}) is of high interest for precision agriculture and the validation of large scale {SMC} products. Data-driven approaches are the most common method to retrieve {SMC} with {UAS}-borne data at water limited sites over non-disturbed agricultural crops. A major disadvantage of data-driven algorithms is the limited transferability in space and time and the need of a high number of ground reference samples. Physically-based approaches are less dependent on the amount of samples and are transferable in space and time. This study explores the potential of (1) a hybrid method targeting the soil brightness factor of the {PROSAIL} model using a variational heteroscedastic Gaussian Processes regression ({VHGPR}) algorithm, and (2) a data-driven method employing {VHGPR} for the retrieval of {SMC} over three grassland sites based on {UAS}-borne {VIS}–{NIR} (399–1001nm) hyperspectral data. The sites were managed by mowing (Fendt), grazing (Grosses Bruch) and irrigation (Marquardt). With these distinct local pre-conditions we aimed to identify factors that favor and limit the retrieval of {SMC}. The hybrid approach presented encouraging results in Marquardt ({RMSE} = 1.5Vol\_\%, R2 = 0.2). At the permanent grassland sites (Fendt, Grosses Bruch) the thatch layer jeopardized the application of the hybrid model. We identified the complex canopy structure of grassland as the main factor impacting the hybrid {SMC} retrieval. The data-driven approach showed high accuracy for Fendt (R2 = 0.84, {RMSE} = 8.66) and Marquardt (R2 = 0.4, {RMSE} = 10.52). All data-driven models build on the {LAI}-{SMC} relationship. However, this relationship was hampered by mowing (Fendt), leading to a lack of transferability in time. The alteration of plant traits by grazing prevents finding a relationship with {SMC} in Grosses Bruch. In Marquardt, we identified the timelag between changes in {SMC} and plant response as the main reason of decrease in model accuracy. Yet, the model performance is accurate in undisturbed and water-limited areas (Marquardt). The analysis points to challenges that need to be tackled in future research and opens the discussion for the development of robust models to retrieve high resolution {SMC} from {UAS}-borne remote sensing observations.},

	abstract = {Snow and ice melt processes on the Greenland Ice Sheet are a key in Earth's energy balance and are acutely sensitive to climate change. Melting dynamics are directly related to a decrease in surface albedo, amongst others caused by the accumulation of light-absorbing particles ({LAPs}). Featuring unique spectral patterns, these accumulations can be mapped and quantified by imaging spectroscopy. We present first results for the retrieval of glacier ice properties from the spaceborne {PRISMA} imaging spectrometer by applying a recently developed simultaneous inversion of atmospheric and surface state using optimal estimation. The image analyzed in this study was acquired over the South-West margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet in late August 2020. The area is characterized by patterns of both clean and dark ice associated with a high amount of {LAPs} deposited on the surface. We present retrieval maps and uncertainties for grain size, liquid water, and algae concentration, as well as estimated reflectance spectra for different surface properties. We then show the feasibility of using imaging spectroscopy to interpret multiband sensor data to achieve high accuracy, frequently repeated observations of changing snow and ice conditions. For example, the impurity index calculated from multiband Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument measurements is dependent on dust particles, but we show that algae concentration alone can be predicted from this data with less than 20\% uncertainty. Our study evidences that present and upcoming orbital imaging spectroscopy missions such as {PRISMA}, Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program, Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging Mission, and the Surface Biology and Geology designated observable, can significantly support research of melting ice sheets.},
